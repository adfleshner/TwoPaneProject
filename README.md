This is my attempt at creating a two pane application for tablets that intelligently corrects itself to be flexible for phones.

It currently uses 
```gradle
com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.3.0
com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.3.0
com.aurelhubert:ahbottomnavigation:1.1.0
com.android.support:design:23.3.0
```
in the project to create the different views you see in the project.
